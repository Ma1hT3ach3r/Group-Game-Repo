In the land of Raliteria, there was a Maze!
The Maze was rumored to have many riches and treasures, that can not be found anywhere else.
And whoever came out of the maze, would be granted a single wish.
4 people have went into the maze.
A Vampire, who wants to become human once more.
An Alchemist, who wants to become immortal and all powerful.
A Mage, who wants to become the most Knowledgeable and powerful mage ever to exist.
And... An oddity, forgotten by time.
Will they come out as Champions?
Or will they become a nice meal for the monsters?
Only time will tell...
